# Conditionals: Control Flow
- `if else` makes the program more dynamic

## Logical and comparison Operators
- `Comparison Operators`
    - `<` - 'Less than' operator
    - `>`  - 'Greater than' operator
    - `<=` - 'Less than or equal' operator
    - `>=` - 'Greater than or equal' operator 
    - `==` and `!=` operators check if their operands are equal or not
- `Logical Operators`
    - `&&` - Logical and -> Returns True if both statements are true
    - `||` - Logical or -> Returns True if one of the statements is true
    - `!` - Logical not -> Reverses the result, returns the False if the result is true

## Switch Statement
- The switch statement is ideal for few values while `if else` should be used for complex comparisions with comparison and logical operators
- Inside `case` you need `return` or `break`
