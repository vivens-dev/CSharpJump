# Conditionals: Control Flow
- `if else` makes the program more dynamic

## Logical and comparison Operators
- `Comparison Operators`
    - `<` - 'Less than' operator
    - `>`  - 'Greater than' operator
    - `<=` - 'Less than or equal' operator
    - `>=` - 'Greater than or equal' operator 
    - `==` and `!=` operators check if their operands are equal or not
- `Logical Operators`
    - `&&` - Logical and -> Returns True if both statements are true
    - `||` - Logical or -> Returns True if one of the statements is true
    - `!` - Logical not -> Reverses the result, returns the False if the result is true

## Switch Statement
- The switch statement is ideal for few values while `if else` should be used for complex comparisions with comparison and logical operators
- Inside `case` you need `return` or `break`

## Ternary Operator
- `?:` operator - the ternary conditional operator
- The conditional operator `?:`, also known as the ternary conditional operator, evaluates a Boolean expression and returns the result of one of the two expressions, depending on whether the Boolean expression evaluates to true or false,
- Allows to simplify `if else` to a single line of code
- The structure of a ternary operator: `expression ? true : false`
- eg: `var weather = tempInCelsius < 20.0 ? "Cold." : "Perfect!";`
