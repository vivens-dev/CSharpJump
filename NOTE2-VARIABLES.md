# VARIABLES
* A variable stores some value
* The name for a variable is called an `identifier`
* Rules for `identifiers`
- Cannot start with a number (C# is a compiled language and we will be able to see errors before even running the code)
- Can start with an underscore
- C# is case-sensitive, the casing of identifiers is important
* Every variable has a type
* **var**
C# is statically typed programming language, every variable is given a data type upfront, **var** just makes it easier for devs if they don't know what that type is going to be, it figures out the type based on what we're assigning to it
* Variables allow dynamicness in the application
- Other ways for making applications dynamic and more useful: Reading from files, system settings, databases...
* An `expression` evaluates to a value

## * The process of creating variables
* The process of creating variables consits of  of 2 steps: `declaration` and `initialization`
* C# will give you an error if you try to use a variable which has not been initialized
* There are situations where you might need to declare a variable without initilization because you don't know the value yet
