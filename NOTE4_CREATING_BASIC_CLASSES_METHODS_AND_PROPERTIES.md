# Creating Basic Classes, Methods, and Properties
- `Class`: A class is used to represent things, to define their structure, illustatration: a header for an Excel spreadsheet
- `Instance`: An instance is the thing represented by the class; for example we can create a `class` to represent a person; An `instance` of that class would be `Vivens Ndatinya`
- `Constructor`: A constructor is used to create a instance of a class, you can create `custom constructors`
- A class can have `members`, a generic word englobing `properties`, `fields`, `methods`, `constructors`
    - Everything that goes inside a class is known as a `member`
- `Property` > A property contains a value
- `Method` > A method does something
- `Field` > A field is similar to a property but it is private, used to store data inside a class > CONVENTION: The name of a field starts with a lowerCase letter
