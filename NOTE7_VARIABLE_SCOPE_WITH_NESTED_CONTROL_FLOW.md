# Variable Scope With Nested Control Flow
* When we declare a variable, it's scoped to the curl braces (block) it's declared in
* Variables created within a method are not going to be available outside the method
* `GLOBAL VARIABLES`
    - `Global variables` are created at the class level, and they can cause naming conflcit, ONLY CREATE VARIABLES WHEN YOU NEED THEM
